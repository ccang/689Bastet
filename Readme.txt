689方塊 - 會玩到你好激氣既俄羅斯方塊

林子祥有云，數字人生。
整左隻新遊戲， 唔知改咩名好。見到711便利店，同埋759阿信屋，受到佢地既啟發，於是改咗呢隻遊戲個名做689方塊。
顧名思義，呢隻遊戲，唔係普通既俄羅斯方塊。
香港人好想要既野，香港人既689死都唔俾； 但香港人唔想要既野，香港人既689就俾到足。
呢隻變種既俄羅斯方塊亦都一樣。你等緊一塊長條型方塊，希望一次清空4行？唔駛旨意。
如果你想挑戰難度，689方塊絕對俾到你!

689Bastet - an evil clone of Tetris

This is not an ordinary version of Tetris.
Just like Mr.689 who doesn't give Hong Kong residents what they really wants but gives them what they hate instead,
689Bastet doesn't give you the bricks you want most but tries to give you the bricks you don't want.
Are you waiting for a long I-shaped brick to clear 4 lines? It won't give you!
If you want to be frustrated and smash your phone, 689Bastet is for you!

To Install:
1. Go to the folder "App" and download the file "app-release.apk"
2. If you saved this file to your computer, copy it to your Android phone
3. Run this file in your phone.

Controls:
1. Swipe left/right/down: move the brick; Touch once: rotate the brick; Back or Home buttons: pause the game
2. A higher level means not only faster speed but less chance to get even a slightly better brick.

System Requirements:
- Android 2.3.3 or higher. Best for Android 4 or higher.
- At least 4 MB of memory space
