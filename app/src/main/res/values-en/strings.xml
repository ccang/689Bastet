        This is not an ordinary version of Tetris.\n\n
Just like Mr.689 who doesn\'t give Hong Kong residents what they really wants but gives them what they hate instead,
689Bastet doesn\'t give you the bricks you want most but tries to give you the bricks you don\'t want.\n\n
Are you waiting for a long I-shaped brick to clear 4 lines? It won\'t give you!\n\n
If you like the feeling of frustration or want to smash your phone, 689Bastet is for you!\n\n

How to play:\n
Controls:\n
  (1) Flick left/right/down: move the brick;\n
  (2) Touch once: rotate the brick;\n
  (3) Back or Home buttons: pause the game.\n
Difficulty: A higher level means not only faster speed but less chance to get even a slightly better brick.\n\n
